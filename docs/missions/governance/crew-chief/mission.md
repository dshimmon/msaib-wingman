Lifecycle: **active** and **portfolio-primary**. Call sign: **CREW-CHIEF**.

Maverick authorized Crew Chief v1 implementation and exactly one local commit
on 2026-08-09. When read from that implementation commit, this record describes
an implementation candidate that is implemented and tested locally, locally
committed, and awaiting an independent bootstrap audit. The implementation
commit intentionally does not record its own hash inside itself.

Crew Chief is not published, not operational, not independently audited, and
not mission-complete. No live model audit occurred during implementation, and
a real Crew Chief acceptance run requires later separate authorization.

## Approved responsibility

The [Wingman Vault](../../../../WINGMAN_VAULT.md#crew-chief) defines Crew Chief
as the independent audit function in the mandatory review loop: receive the
Codex report and evidence, independently audit the authorized work, return
findings to Codex for resolution or evidence-backed dispute, and support a
final evidence package for Maverick. Findings begin as advisory, and Crew Chief
cannot expand scope, mutate repository state, authorize work, or overrule
Maverick.

## Implemented boundary

The approved implementation contains the project-scoped
[`crew-chief` agent](../../../../.codex/agents/crew-chief.toml), the
deterministic [`tools/crew_chief`](../../../../tools/crew_chief/) controller and
versioned schemas, the canonical [runbook](../../../runbooks/crew-chief.md),
and credential-free tests. [GOV-004](../../../decisions/governance/crew-chief-audit.md)
defines the enduring workflow and bootstrap boundary.

The exact evidence and validation record belongs in [`evidence.md`](evidence.md),
with chronological build notes in [`journal.md`](journal.md). The exact next
gate is a fresh ordinary Codex bootstrap audit that operates read-only and
states, “This bootstrap audit is not a Crew Chief audit.” Crew Chief cannot
audit or certify this initial implementation. Any controlled real Crew Chief
acceptance run is a later, separately authorized gate.
